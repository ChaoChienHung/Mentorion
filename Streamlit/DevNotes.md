# Development Notes

1. **Streamlit Widgets Mechanism**:
In Streamlit, any interaction with a widget (e.g., sliders, buttons, text inputs, or select boxes) triggers a script rerun. This is because widgets are stateful, and Streamlit always reruns the script top-to-bottom to reflect the updated widget state. Understanding this behavior is critical to designing reliable and efficient Streamlit apps.
  
1. **Uploader Keys**:
In Streamlit, widgets such as `st.file_uploader` are stateful and persist their values across script reruns. Since Streamlit reruns the entire script whenever a user interacts with the UI, an uploaded file may be unintentionally reprocessed multiple times. Additionally, Streamlit enforces a strict rule: "Once a widget is instantiated with a given key, its corresponding st.session_state[key] cannot be modified during the same run." When attempting to clear the file uploader by directly setting: `st.session_state.note_uploader = None`, Streamlit raises an exception. This prevents developers from resetting the uploader after processing a file and leads to repeated uploads and duplicated backend requests. So instead of modifying the widget’s session state directly, the recommended approach is to change the widget key itself. Streamlit treats widgets with different keys as entirely new widgets.
