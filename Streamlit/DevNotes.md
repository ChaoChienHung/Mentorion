# Development Notes
1. **Uploader Keys**: In Streamlit, widgets such as `st.file_uploader` are stateful and persist their values across script reruns. Since Streamlit reruns the entire script whenever a user interacts with the UI, an uploaded file may be unintentionally reprocessed multiple times. Additionally, Streamlit enforces a strict rule: "Once a widget is instantiated with a given key, its corresponding st.session_state[key] cannot be modified during the same run." When attempting to clear the file uploader by directly setting: `st.session_state.note_uploader = None`, Streamlit raises an exception. This prevents developers from resetting the uploader after processing a file and leads to repeated uploads and duplicated backend requests. So instead of modifying the widget’s session state directly, the recommended approach is to change the widget key itself. Streamlit treats widgets with different keys as entirely new widgets.
